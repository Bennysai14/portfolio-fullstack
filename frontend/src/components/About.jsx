      <p style={{ color: "#e5e7eb", lineHeight: 1.6, marginTop: 16}}>
       Software Engineer with 2+ years of experience in full stack and mobile development, focusing on Flutter apps and scalable backend services. Skilled across Dart, Flutter, React, Java/Spring Boot, REST APIs, and SQL, with hands‑on work building and deploying mobile‑first solutions in production environments. Comfortable designing end‑to‑end features—from API contracts and data models to UI, testing, and release—inside agile teams using Jira, Git, and CI/CD pipelines.​

Experienced with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB, and tools like Docker, Jenkins, Postman, and CloudWatch for observability and automation. Strong foundation in computer science from a B.E. in CSE and an in‑progress M.S. in Computer Science at Missouri S&T, with coursework in web development, algorithms, and systems. Recently contributed to AI/ML projects, fraud detection backends, Linux monitoring tools, and onboarding automation scripts, always aiming to improve reliability, performance, and developer experience.

        Flutter UIs, React frontends, and Java/Spring Boot APIs. Your experience integrating REST APIs, securing authentication with Firebase and API-based logins, and tuning state management shows you can ship apps that are both smooth for users and robust in production.​

On the backend, you design and deploy services with PostgreSQL and MySQL, add Redis caching to cut response times, and use Docker and Jenkins to automate testing and deployments. You care about code quality, using unit tests, static analysis, GDB debugging, and code reviews to keep systems reliable even as they grow.​

Beyond individual features, you contribute as a teammate in Agile environments: breaking work into sprints, collaborating with developers and testers, and helping simulate failure and recovery scenarios for better reliability and security. You continuously upskill through certifications and courses like Python full stack, Agile with Jira, and CS50, while learning tools such as FastAPI and TypeScript and giving back via open‑source SDK contributions.
